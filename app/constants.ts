Exploring the program's heritage tourism potential, the THC designed its MoMS training to advance interdisciplinary partnerships and emphasize the strategic alignment of storytelling, experience development, and promotion. This approach made room for different kinds of community organizations and their unique skills. More importantly, it treated capacity-building, specifically in regard to the cultivation of robust heritage landscapes, as a community-wide or regional aim, not just an organizational one. Attendees will hear from THC staff and past MoMS participants on successful partnerships, challenges, and lessons learned. Key takeaways include strategies for regional collaboration, understanding different organizational needs, and best practices for heritage tourism initiatives.",

These funds can be transformative for small museums enabling giant leaps forward, incremental change, and exploration of new initiatives that would otherwise be unattainable due to limited resources. Inspire grant recipients share their experiences and the impact these project-specific grant funds have made on their museums.

Based on current initiatives at art and history museums, we will discuss using collections as a starting place for dialogs that connect audiences with contemporary social and community interests. We hope to provide curators and interpreters with a new framework for looking at material culture by walking through examples using artifacts from the Texas Historical Commission’s Historic Sites.",

Explore how you can incorporate a S.T.E.A.M. mindset into your facility using cross-curricular, multi-modal approaches to help connect all learners to your core subject matter. S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) has been a buzzword for some time and is often used to help justify field trips or get donors on board with an eye to workforce preparedness. Recently, an A for Art has been added to change the S.T.E.M. to S.T.E.A.M. but, rather than treating art as a science and vice versa, art is often used superficially to convey scientific concepts. Additionally, museums that do not deal directly with science or art as a core subject matter, may find it more difficult to make meaningful connections to S.T.E.A.M. in their programming and displays. Looking at subject matter in a cross-curricular, multi-modal way is fundamental for making all learners feel successful, creating equitable pathways for discovery and creating meaningful connections to content.",

Our workshop addresses the growing need for media preservation skills among archivists, historians, curators, genealogists, and generally those who work with historic materials. In this 3 hour workshop, participants will learn how to identify common media formats, conduct preservation assessments, and digitize video formats. Attendees will become confident in their ability to identify and preserve analog film and video formats and gain the skills necessary to work with these materials when encountering them in the field. This workshop is hosted by Ari Negovschi Regalado, Technical Director of Texas Archive of the Moving Image. ",
